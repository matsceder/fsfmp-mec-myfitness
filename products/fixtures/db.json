But if you play your cards right, there are no reason to suspect that you can&rsquo;t place in the top range of the muscle gain rates above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Muscle growth in biceps\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.strengthlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Muscle-growth-in-biceps-in-1300-participants.png?w=825&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"width:60%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The diagram above shows the increase of muscle area in the biceps, in a massive study where a total of 1 300 previously untrained subjects trained their biceps two times a week, for twelve weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What Causes Your Muscles to Grow?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your muscles grow&nbsp;</strong>when you load them, and then provide protein via food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two things happen when you train, not necessarily connected to each other:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Your muscles are&nbsp;<em>damaged</em>&nbsp;and needs repair.</li>\r\n\t<li>Your muscles send signals that&nbsp;<em>they need to grow</em>, and a growth process is initiated.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Research have shown that after a rigorous workout, the&nbsp;<em>muscle protein synthesis</em>&nbsp;(that is, the process in which new muscle protein is generated) is elevated for 48&ndash;72 hours, with the greatest increase during the first 24 hours, somewhat depending on how much and hard you trained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Muscle growth from 1 vs 3 sets\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.strengthlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1-vs-3-sets.png?fit=1024%2C723&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"width:60%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After another day or two, your muscles are usually completely recovered and ready to be trained again. Exactly how long it takes depends on how hard you have trained in relation to what your muscles are used to.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How Often Should You Train?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The key to building muscle without getting yourself injured is to train stimulating workouts, with adequate rest between sessions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to training for performance (such as strength), the relationship between stimulus, rest and performance is often illustrated with a curve similar to the one below. The same principle is also applicable in training where muscle growth is the objective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Recovery between workouts\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.strengthlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Recovery-between-workouts.png?w=825&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"width:60%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How often you should train</strong>&nbsp;is closely tied to&nbsp;<em>how much</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>how hard</em>&nbsp;you train every session, since you need more time to recover after a grueling workout than a light one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, the research shows that there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be much of a difference at all between training your muscles one, two or three times per week as long as the total volume is the same, so your training frequency and disposition of sessions seems to be more a matter of personal preference and individualization than anything else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Recommendations:</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Train each muscle about 1&ndash;3 times per week.</li>\r\n\t<li>Generally let your muscles rest at least 2&ndash;3 days after a hard workout.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>How Much Should You Train?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The more you train, the more you&rsquo;ll grow &ndash; to a point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where that point lies is the topic of much research and debate, and the issue is complicated by the fact that optimal training volume for&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;likely depends on&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;specific circumstances:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>How used are you to training?</li>\r\n\t<li>How good are your recovery capabilities?</li>\r\n\t<li>How many workouts do you spread your training volume over?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>At least 10 sets per muscle and week seems to be a good volume to aim for, for the great majority of trainees. Up to that level, the rate of muscle gain increase the more you train.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Training volume and muscle growth\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.strengthlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Optimal-training-volume-for-muscle-growth.png?w=825&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"width:60%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But where is the upper limit where additional training no longer leads to greater growth?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, to the best of my knowledge, there is only one good study on trained subjects where an advantage to higher training volumes have been observed (all the way up to 32 sets per muscle and week)&nbsp;&ndash; and several where no advantage have been observed compared to a more moderate volume of 10&ndash;12 sets per week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In practice, a large number of bodybuilders (whose sole training goal is muscle growth) train considerably more than 10 sets per muscle and week, and a conservative guess on my part is that a training volume that is productive for many when they are accustomed to training, is somewhere between 10&ndash;20 sets per muscle and week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that the numbers above generally applies to sets taken to failure. If you do easier sets where you stop further from failure, you might be able to increase that number, or&nbsp;<em>have to</em>&nbsp;increase it to reach the same effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Recommendations:</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Do at least 10 hard sets (= close to failure) per week and muscle for optimal growth.</li>\r\n\t<li>The upper limit where more training no longer leads to more muscle growth is currently unknown, and likely depends on several factors. A guess is somewhere around 15&ndash;20 sets per week for a trained person with good recovery capabilities.</li>\r\n\t<li>The closer to failure you train, the more stress that particular set induces. If you stop a few reps shy of failure, you can probably increase the number of sets and do a little larger total volume, with better muscle growth as a result.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.strengthlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Man-training-deadlifts.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How Heavy Should You Train?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent research has shown that it doesn&rsquo;t really matter if you train with light or heavy weights &ndash; you can build muscles using both, provided that you exhaust your muscles with them. That is to say: train close enough to failure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exception to the rule is if you use very light or very heavy weights &ndash; the the muscle building effect per set will decrease, even if you train close to failure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Muscle growth from training with light or heavy weights\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.strengthlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Muscle-growth-from-different-training-load.png?w=825&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"width:60%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The diagram above shows the muscle growth (measured as cross-sectional area)&nbsp;in a study&nbsp;where the subjects where divided into four different groups, which all trained with different loads for 12 weeks. It turned out that only the group which trained with very light weights experienced sub-optimal muscle growth &ndash; in the other three groups, muscle growth was similar. The lightest group used 20% of their 1RM (max), which they lifted for about 50&ndash;85 reps per set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most classic &ldquo;muscle-building zone&rdquo; when it comes to load, is probably to use a weight where you can do about 8&ndash;15 reps per set. It is both effective for muscle growth, and from a practical perspective also a pretty comfortable weight to work with &ndash; not so heavy that it is challenging to maintain technique, but not so light that you have to do endless reps until your muscles feel like they are burning in the end of the set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Recommendations:</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Train with a weight where you can do about 5&ndash;40 reps per set, for the greatest muscle building effect. A good rule of thumb is to strive for about 8&ndash;15 reps per set.</li>\r\n\t<li>If you train with heavier weights, where you only can do about 1&ndash;5 reps per set, the muscle building effect per set decreases, but on the other hand you will likely make better gains in strength.</li>\r\n\t<li>Don&rsquo;t train to failure in every set, but stay 1&ndash;3 reps short of failure in most sets. Maybe take one or two sets per exercise to failure, for example the last ones.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Best Exercises to Build Muscle</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>What makes an exercise good for building muscle?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is an exercise that &hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>trains multiple muscles at the same time &ndash; often called&nbsp;<em>compound movements</em>.</li>\r\n\t<li>trains the muscle through a long range of motion.</li>\r\n\t<li>is stable enough for the muscle force to be a limiting factor of your performance, not balance.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Exercises where you train multiple muscles at the same time are time effective, and makes a good foundation in your training routine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Four examples of exercises that together trains pretty much all the major muscle groups in your body is:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Squats&nbsp;which trains your quadriceps, glutes, adductors and lower back.</li>\r\n\t<li>Bench press&nbsp;which trains your chest, front deltoids and triceps.</li>\r\n\t<li>Deadlifts&nbsp;which trains your back, glutes and posterior thighs.</li>\r\n\t<li>Lat pulldowns&nbsp;or&nbsp;barbell rows&nbsp;which trains your biceps, lats and rear deltoids.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.strengthlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Four-exercises-for-full-body-training.jpg?fit=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Four exercises: bench press, rows, deadlifts and squats. If this was all you did in the gym, you&rsquo;d still train nearly all major muscle groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exercises that&nbsp;<em>isolate</em>&nbsp;the training to one or just a few muscles, such as&nbsp;bicep curls, can however be useful when you really want to focus on one muscle and make sure that it gets trained thoroughly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A classic recipe for a good, muscle-building workout is to start the session with compound movements that train multiple muscles at the same time, and then move on to isolation exercises to target individual muscles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Recommendations:</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Begin your workout with compound movements that train multiple muscles simultaneously, to save time.</li>\r\n\t<li>Move on to isolation exercises that targets the muscles in which you want to prioritize growth.</li>\r\n\t<li>Use exercises that are stable and let&rsquo;s you work in a long range of motion.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Training Programs For Building Muscle</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Which training program is the best for you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That depends on:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Your conditions:&nbsp;</strong>How used are you to training? How often can you train?</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Your goals:&nbsp;</strong>How ambitious are you? A little training goes a long way, but more training can generally produce even better results, even if the returns are diminishing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Check out our training programs to find one that fits you!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What Should You Eat to Build Muscle?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two main things you should pay attention to in your diet when you&rsquo;re looking to build muscle:</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>1. Protein</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Resistance training increases your&nbsp;protein requirement, and a sufficiently protein-rich diet will give you better training results, both in terms of greater strength gains as well as muscle growth. Protein that you eat in connection to training has a large muscle building effect.</li>\r\n\t<li>The average person eats about 1.1 g of protein per kg each day, but research has shown that maximal muscle growth needs about 1.4&ndash;2 g protein&nbsp;per kg and day.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>2. Calories</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The amount of calories you eat affects your muscle growth in several ways. By eating enough to meet your daily caloric demands (or even more), you will get the best conditions for gaining muscle: you will both get energy to fuel hard training, and your body will have plenty of resources to spend in reparation and adaptation afterwards.</li>\r\n\t<li>A caloric deficit can lower your muscle protein synthesis (that is, your rate of muscle growth) by 20&ndash;30%, while a caloric surplus increases it.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>So, What Should You Eat?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Exactly what you eat doesn&rsquo;t really matter too much. As long as you meet your protein and caloric requirements, then your muscles will have the most important prerequisites to grow in place. In general, however, it is a good idea to let the majority of your diet consist of varied, nutritious and not overly processed foods.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Supplements for Building Muscle</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>There are no supplements that will either build muscle or burn fat for you. Avoid supplements that claim to be muscle building, testosterone boosting or fat burning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of today, there are only two supplements that robust scientific evidence for being beneficial for your muscle growth and strength gains:</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Protein Powder</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t actually even a supplement, but simply a processed food. Protein powder works by increasing your protein intake, which benefits muscle growth, recovery and strength. Common kinds are&nbsp;whey, caseine and soy protein powder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Protein powder has no special effect that you cannot also get from eating more protein-rich food, so it&rsquo;s benefits lie more in it&rsquo;s low pricing (per gram of protein) and practicality.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Creatine</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>To date the best supplement you can take for aiding your muscle building.&nbsp;Creatine&nbsp;works by increasing the stores of creatine phosphate in your muscles, which is used as a quick energy source when training. It has been studied in more than a thousand clinical trials and has consistently been proven to increase performance in high intensity activities, such as resistance training or sprints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you do resistance training and take extra creatine, you will get slightly larger gains of strength and muscle volume, than if you only had trained. Furthermore, creatine seems to be able to decrease the muscle damage following a workout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other than&nbsp;protein powder&nbsp;and&nbsp;creatine, there&rsquo;s only one other supplement worth mentioning in the same breath, and that is&nbsp;caffeine. Caffeine can be positive for your muscle growth by improving your performance in the gym: if you train harder, then you can stimulate the muscles to grow more.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Frequently Asked Questions About Building Muscle</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m going to wrap this article up by answering some common questions on gaining muscle.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Can you build muscle and lose fat at the same time?</li>\r\n\t<li>Is it harder to build muscle as you get older?</li>\r\n\t<li>Does women have a harder time building muscle than men?</li>\r\n\t<li>Are free weights or machines best for building muscle?</li>\r\n\t<li>How long should you rest between sets?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Can You Build Muscle and Lose Fat at the Same Time?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The short answer is yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The longer answer begins with&nbsp;maybe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In summary, it is certainly possible to gain muscle and lose fat during the same time period. Both in untrained and trained persons, it is a pretty common result that after 2&ndash;3 months of resistance training, they have gained a few pounds of muscle and lost a few pounds of fat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The less trained you are, the more likely it is that you will have these kind of results (or the more profound they will be), since muscle mass simply increases faster in untrained muscles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other factors that will positively influence your ability to build muscle and lose fat at the same time is:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Protein.</strong>&nbsp;A high enough protein intake, about 1.4&ndash;2 g protein&nbsp;per kg body weight and day.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Sleep.</strong>&nbsp;Enough sleep increases your muscle growth, decreases your muscle breakdown, and leads to a better body composition (the ratio between muscles and fat). Most adults need between 7&ndash;9 hours of sleep per night, and hard training likely increase the need for sleep.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Is It Harder to Build Muscle as You Get Older?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a fact that we, on a population level, lose muscle mass as we age. If you lead a sedentary life, you will start losing your muscle mass sometime after 30 years of age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Muscle loss due to aging\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.strengthlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Muscle-loss-due-to-aging.png?fit=1024%2C742&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"width:60%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is probably an effect caused by several factors that usually accompanies increased age:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Lower muscle protein synthesis</li>\r\n\t<li>Chronic inflammations</li>\r\n\t<li>Physical inactivity</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The good news is that resistance training is an excellent medicine against muscle loss, and something of the fountain of youth in this regard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But maintaining muscle mass and strength is one thing &ndash; what about&nbsp;<em>increasing</em>&nbsp;them? Is it harder to build muscle as you get older?</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>One study with 70 men and women, which were around either 65 or 25 years of age, found that the participants at 65 years of age built about 75% of the muscle mass that the 25 year olds did, on the same training program. In the same study, it was found that the older participants needed to train slightly more than the youngsters to gain muscle and strength.</li>\r\n\t<li>In another study with 287 participants, age didn&rsquo;t have any effect at all on muscle growth. During a 22 week long training period, participants between 60&ndash;78 years old gained just as much muscle as the ones between 19&ndash;45 years old.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that this is for&nbsp;<em>relative</em>&nbsp;gains. As older persons generally have less muscle mass than younger persons to begin with, the&nbsp;<em>absolute</em>&nbsp;gains are probably slightly lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if the conditions for muscle growth gets worse with age, we can at least conclude that even a very old person that takes up resistance training can increase their muscle mass and strength, even upwards 80&ndash;90 years of age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have been training all your life, then you shouldn&rsquo;t expect to raise your muscle mass to higher levels as an 80-year old than you had as a 30-year old, but at least the weight training will be very effective in slowing your decline, and keeping up good strength and function for a long time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Is It Harder for Women to Build Muscle Than It Is for Men?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Once again, it is relevant to talk about the difference between&nbsp;<em>relative</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>absolute</em>&nbsp;muscle gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Women and men get an equal amount of muscle growth from resistance training,&nbsp;<em>relatively</em>&nbsp;speaking.</li>\r\n\t<li>But, as women generally has lower muscle mass than men to begin with, the&nbsp;<em>absolute</em>&nbsp;muscle growth is generally smaller.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The similarity of muscle growth in relative terms is clearly seen in the enormous study with 1 300 participants (58% women, 42% men) mentioned earlier in this article, where the researchers didn&rsquo;t see any difference between the sexes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Similar muscle growth between men and women\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.strengthlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Muscle-growth-in-biceps-in-1300-participants.png?resize=825%2C529&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"width:60%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Are Free Weights or Machines Best for Building Muscle?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>For a tool to be effective for building muscle, it should be:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><em>Stable enough&nbsp;</em>so that muscle force, and not balance, is the limiting factor of performance.</li>\r\n\t<li>Able to place a large enough&nbsp;<em>load&nbsp;</em>on the muscle, through a&nbsp;<em>long range of motion</em>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Both free weights and machines can fulfill these demands, and it is rather a question of what specific exercises or machines we are talking about, than a sharp line in the sand.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Machines</strong>&nbsp;often have the benefit (in terms of muscle hypertrophy) that they take care of the balancing for you. If your primary goal is to train a muscle to complete exhaustion, then that might be an advantage as you can focus completely on the muscle instead. An advantage of machines however, is that they seldom fit all body types, or can even be poorly designed in general. And of course: you do miss out on the balance training.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Free weights</strong>&nbsp;demand that you balance and stabilize the weights yourself. This could potentially distract you from focusing on the working muscles. Many exercises done with free weights are however&nbsp;<em>stable enough</em>&nbsp;and therefore excellent for building muscle. Free weight training have the additional benefit that they fit more body types in a way that machines don&rsquo;t. They will also give you more so called &ldquo;functional training&rdquo;, in the sense that you get more practice at actually lifting and moving physical objects.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Both tools can work excellently for muscle building, and it is likely other factors that will determine which is the most useful for your situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How Long Should You Rest Between Sets?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The short answer is: as long as you need to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important factors for muscle growth is to exhaust your muscles by lifting sufficiently heavy weights in sufficiently large volumes. Rest between sets can therefore both aid or impair that goal:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>If you only have a short time to train</strong>, then it benefits you to have short rest periods between sets, so that you can squeeze in as many sets (and thereby more muscle work) as possible.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>If you have plenty of time to train</strong>, and have a predetermined amount of sets that you are planning to do, for example if you are following a training program that says you should do five sets of an exercise, then it benefits you to rest as long as possible. That will make you perform better in each set, either by lifting more weight or doing more reps, which in turn has been proven to yield better muscle growth.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>A standard recommendation that often is appropriate is to rest about 2&ndash;3 minutes between sets. It is long enough to recover your performance for the next set, but not so long that your workout will take overly much time.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>That&rsquo;s it!</strong>&nbsp;You&rsquo;ve reached the end of our guide on building muscle.</p>"}},{"model":"programs.programs","pk":10,"fields":{"author":1,"category":1,"post_date":"2020-08-21","title":"How Many Reps Should You Do to Build Muscle vs. Strength?","snippet":"Should you do low reps with heavy weights or high reps with light weights?

Many repetitions with a light weight give you different results than if you do a few repetitions with a heavy weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The heaviest weight you can lift in one repetition is called your&nbsp;<em>1RM</em>, 1 repetition maximum. The lighter the weight in relation to your 1RM, the more repetitions, or reps, you will be able to do in one set. Exactly how many repetitions you can do on a given percentage of your 1RM depends on many variables, such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>The exercise.&nbsp;</strong>Can you rest at the top or bottom of the exercise (as in&nbsp;deadlifts)? What does the movement path and the force curve look like?</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Muscles.</strong>&nbsp;Is the exercise performed by muscles that are primarily fatigue resistant or explosive?</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Genetics.</strong>&nbsp;What does your individual muscle fiber type distribution look like?</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Training.</strong>&nbsp;What have you practiced the most? Have you trained with mostly a high or low number of repetitions?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if the variation is large, there are still some averages that can be good to know of. I do not know where the table below comes from, but I think it fits well enough for me to use it as a starting point when I plan training programs and such.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"w-75\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.strengthlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1.png?w=825&amp;ssl=1\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typical values ​​of how many repetitions you can do at different % of 1RM. Note that the variation is large depending on exercise, the individual and training background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on how heavy you lift and how many reps you do, your muscles will be activated differently.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Muscle Activation at Different Loads</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>There are thousands of small muscle fibers in your muscles. These are recruited as needed and in increasing size: the small ones are activated first, when the need for muscle power is small. But as you lift heavier loads, more and larger muscle fibers are activated. When you lift the maximum of what you&rsquo;re capable of in a single lift, virtually all muscle fibers are activated at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the muscle fibers cooperate, relieving each other of work as they get tired, if possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s say you do a set at 60% of 1RM, where you normally manage about 20 repetitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>At the beginning of the set, it&rsquo;s enough that only some of your muscle fibers contract to lift the weight.</li>\r\n\t<li>After a few repetitions, however, the first muscle fibers begin to become tired and lose strength, and other, larger and stronger muscle fibers join in to help to create force.</li>\r\n\t<li>As the set goes on, more and more muscle fibers are exhausted, and more are recruited to join in. And after a while, there are not enough rested and strong muscle fibers to create force enough to lift the weight, and the set is over. You have reached&nbsp;failure, the point where you can&rsquo;t lift the weight for another rep.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Only the muscle fibers that work and create force will grow. If they contract hard enough for a sufficient number of times, the growth process is started.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Muscle Growth Requires Sufficiently Many Reps, at a Sufficiently Heavy Weight</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>To get good muscle growth, you need to tire out your muscles. The more muscle fibers in the muscle you tire out, the more that muscle will grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two common pitfalls that can inhibit muscle growth when it comes to number of repetitions and choice of weight:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Too few reps with a too light weight.&nbsp;</strong>Let&rsquo;s say you pick a weight which you could do 20 reps with, but you only do five. In that case, only a small number of your muscle fibers would be recruited and used, and they would probably not even be particularly exhausted either. Would you continue the set, however, then you would gradually recruit and exhaust more and more muscle fibers, and if you would have done about 17&ndash;20 reps, then most of your muscle fibers would receive a good training stimulus.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Too heavy weight.</strong>&nbsp;Assume instead that you pick a very heavy weight, which you can only lift for a single repetition. All of your muscle fibers will contract maximally from the start, and when you&rsquo;re finished with the first repetition, your strongest and most explosive muscle fibers will be exhausted. Your weaker but more fatigue resistant fibers, on the other hand, are hardly tired at all, but they cannot lift the heavy weight and continue the set on their own. In this case, you have picked a weight where you can no longer continue the set as soon as only your strongest muscle fibers are exhausted.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Effective muscle-building training&nbsp;</strong>requires you to use a sufficiently heavy weight, and train sufficiently close to failure with it. You do not need to go all the way to failure (that could even be detrimental to your growth if done in exaggeration), but you should train yourself within a couple of reps (~1&ndash;3) from it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Read more:&nbsp;</strong>Training to Failure: Implications for Recovery, Strength and Muscle Gains</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what is a sufficiently heavy weight, then?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we mentioned in the introduction, and as will be seen from the research we will soon take a closer look at, a weight where you can manage about 5&ndash;40 repetitions per set seems appropriate. For practical reasons, about 8&ndash;15 repetitions may be appropriate to aim for; it does not require as much energy and pain as a set of 40 reps, and it may be a little easier to tire out your muscles more thoroughly with a slightly lighter weight than one you can only do five reps with.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Training for Strength Differs from Training for Muscle Growth</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to training for maximum strength, the importance of tiring out every single little fatigue resistant muscle fiber decreases. Instead, the importance of training the biggest and strongest muscle fibers (which may not be so fatigue resistant) increases. And above all, it becomes important to train your neuromuscular system which ensures that not only all muscle fibers, but also all interacting muscles in the exercise are contracted as powerfully and coordinated as possible. And you seem to train this best by simply practicing lifting heavy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Training with weights where you can do about 1&ndash;5 reps per set (&gt;85% of 1RM) seems to be the most effective for strength gains, but training with weights up to about 10&ndash;20 reps per set&nbsp;(~60% of 1RM) is still moderately effective. Lighter than that, and the strength gains diminish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that this applies&nbsp;<em>per set</em>. Although a single rep at 100% may be the training that per set gives you the best return in the form of strength gains, you might be able to do&nbsp;<em>more&nbsp;</em>sets with slightly lighter weights and more reps. Each individual set might not be as effective, but all sets taken together still gives you a better result than the heavy single.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What Does the Research Say?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s move on to the research results that form the basis for the previously mentioned recommendations, and some examples of training programs and their results. This will give you a better understanding of how big the difference in results are between low and high rep training.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Training With 20, 40, 60 or 80% of 1RM</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>One elegantly designed study had the participants train&nbsp;bicep curl&nbsp;and&nbsp;leg press&nbsp;with 20, 40, 60 or 80% of their 1RM for 12 weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was found that muscle growth was equivalent (and good!) for the three groups that trained with 40, 60 and 80% of their 1RM. In this study, this corresponded to a range of about 8&ndash;40 repetitions per set. The group that trained with 20% of 1RM, on the other hand, did about 50-85 repetitions per set, and had clearly poorer muscle growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The diagram below shows the muscle growth in the biceps and quadriceps after 12 weeks of training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Muscle growth from low vs high reps\" class=\"w-75\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.strengthlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Muscle-growth-light-or-heavy-weights.png?w=825&amp;ssl=1\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the increase in strength, it was not quite as even. The two groups who trained with the lightest weights (20 and 40% of 1RM) received worse increases than the groups who trained with heavier weights. In bicep curl, the increase in strength was greater the heavier weights the participants trained with, but in leg press the increase in strength was slightly greater for those who trained with 60% of 1RM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Strength gain from low vs high reps\" class=\"w-75\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.strengthlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Strength-gain-light-or-heavy-weights.png?w=825&amp;ssl=1\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>3&times;3 vs 3&times;10?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Another study compared two classic approaches with each other: 19 participants got to train either 3 sets x 3 reps or 3 sets x 10 reps for eight weeks. More precisely, they should fall between 2&ndash;4 and 8&ndash;12 reps in their sets, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The participants&rsquo; 1RM was tested in the&nbsp;squat&nbsp;and&nbsp;bench press&nbsp;and the muscle thickness in the biceps, triceps and quadriceps was measured before and after the training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the eight weeks, both groups increased their muscle mass and strength. However, the increase in strength was marginally better in the group that trained 2&ndash;4 reps, and the muscle growth was marginally better in the group that trained 8&ndash;12 reps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Muscle growth from 3 vs 10 reps\" class=\"w-75\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.strengthlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Muscle-growth-from-3-vs-10-reps.png?w=825&amp;ssl=1\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Strength gain from 3 vs 10 reps\" class=\"w-75\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/www.strengthlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Strength-gain-from-3-vs-10-reps.png?w=825&amp;ssl=1\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>8&ndash;12 vs 25&ndash;35 reps?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>In yet another study, 18 participants got to train three full-body sessions per week for eight weeks, with seven exercises per session and 3 sets per exercise.&nbsp;One group did 8&ndash;12 reps per set throughout the period, and the other group did 25&ndash;35 reps per set. Muscle thickness was measured in the biceps, triceps and quadriceps, and 1RM was tested in the&nbsp;squat&nbsp;and&nbsp;bench press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After eight weeks of training, it was found that both groups had similar muscle growth, but that the group who trained with 8&ndash;12 reps had increased their strength slightly more than those who trained with 25&ndash;35 reps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Muscle growth from 10 vs 30 reps\" class=\"w-75\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.strengthlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Muscle-growth-from-10-vs-30-reps.png?w=825&amp;ssl=1\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Strength gain from 10 vs 30 reps\" class=\"w-75\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.strengthlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Strength-gain-from-10-vs-30-reps.png?w=825&amp;ssl=1\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>A Meta-Analysis of 21 Studies</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>To get a slightly broader perspective, we can turn to a so-called meta-analysis, ie a kind of article that compiles all studies within an area, from 2017.&nbsp;In this meta-analysis, all training studies with at least two groups of participants who trained with light (&lt;60% of 1RM) or heavy (&gt;60% of 1RM) weights to failure were compiled. By comparison, most people can do about 15&ndash;20 reps on 60% of 1RM when they are fresh and rested. 21 training studies were found and included in the analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the results were compiled, they showed that training with light (&lt;60% of 1RM) and heavy (&gt;60% of 1RM) weights both gave equal muscle growth. But, training with heavier weights (&gt;60% of 1RM) led to slightly greater strength gains than those who trained with less than 60%. However, the difference was not large: the average increase in 1RM among those who trained with heavy weights was 35.4%, compared with an increase of 28.0% for those who trained with lighter weights.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Does Light and Heavy Weights Train Different Muscle Fibers?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Could it be that strength training with heavy weights primarily trains type II fibers, and light weights train type I fibers, and that for maximum muscle growth you should train in both rep ranges?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a literature review from 2018 that examined exactly this, and in that review no significant difference was found where heavy or light strength training would make one or the other type of muscle fiber grow more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For now, it seems that strength training performed with both light and heavy weights leads to the growth of both type I and type II muscle fibers, and somewhat more in the latter. However, the area doesn&rsquo;t seem to be very well-researched yet, and hopefully there will be more research on this in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Should You Vary Your Training With Different Rep Ranges?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a hypothesis that you can get greater muscle growth by varying the load and repetitions you train with, compared to sticking to the same rep range all the time. To my knowledge, this has only been examined in one study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study divided 19 trained participants into two groups. Both groups got to train three full body sessions per week, for an eight-week period.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>One group trained with 8&ndash;12 reps per set, in every workout.</li>\r\n\t<li>The other group trained with 2&ndash;4 reps on workout 1, 8&ndash;12 reps on workout 2, and 20&ndash;30 reps on workout 3.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>After eight weeks, however, no significant difference was seen between the groups, but both increased their muscle mass and strength equally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Personally, I still think there may be a psychological benefit to varying in this way, at least for those who enjoy it. But based on this single, short study, it does not seem to have any earth-shattering effects on your muscle mass compared to just sticking to a medium rep range and trying to increase the weight you lift.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What About Strength Endurance?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This article would not be complete without touching on the trait commonly referred to as strength endurance or perhaps muscle endurance. By that I do not mean the long-lasting sort of muscle endurance that you train in classic cardio training, but rather your ability to lift a light or medium weight for many reps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the type of strength endurance you need when, for example, you are competing in doing a lot of&nbsp;pull-ups&nbsp;or certain Crossfit events. Not the type of exercise that necessarily is challenging for your lungs and your heart, but the kind that requires that your muscles be able to do many reps, in the order of 20&ndash;50 reps, approximately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like with any other training, you get better at what you train. This means that if you want to become good at doing many reps of&nbsp;pull-ups, then doing many reps of pull-ups is the training that will give you the highest return, regardless of whether you currently manage 3 or 30 reps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what if you currently can do 30 reps, and want to train yourself to be able to do 40?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then I suggest a two-part approach:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>Train specifically for muscle endurance.</strong>&nbsp;Train your regular pull-ups with high repetitions. Your muscles will make specific adaptations to that type of work such as larger glycogen stores, higher capillary density, and other things that provide a better ability to convert energy and to work for a long time. As icing on the cake, you get to train your own pain tolerance and practice the strategy of coping with that kind of sets.&nbsp;<em>This training will allow you to do more reps on a given percentage of your 1RM.</em></li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Train to increase your maximum strength.</strong>&nbsp;Train with low reps and heavy weights, by, for example, adding extra weight in a belt. By increasing your maximum strength, your regular pull-ups will be lighter, relatively, which can lead to you being able to do more reps.&nbsp;<em>This training increases your 1RM, so that your regular pull-ups are performed at a lower percentage of 1RM.</em></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Simply put: if you are going to do many reps at a given weight, it is important to be both strong and fatigue resistant, and with this two-part approach you train both qualities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Summary and Practical Application</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, the training effects from light and heavy weights (or high and low reps) overlap, with some differences.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>You can&nbsp;build muscle&nbsp;with a wide range of repetitions, and it is only if you do very few or very many reps per set that the muscle-building effect decreases.</li>\r\n\t<li>In the same way, you can get stronger with a wide range of repetitions, but in general, heavy weights with few reps per set give greater strength increases, and with really light weights (many reps per set) the strength increase is small.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We recommend the following number of reps, with the corresponding appropriate load:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Muscle Growth:</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Anything between about 5&ndash;40 reps per set&nbsp;</strong>(between about 40&ndash;85% of 1RM) has been shown to give good muscle growth. More or fewer reps than that, and the muscle-building effect per set decreases somewhat.</li>\r\n\t<li>For practical reasons, it is a good rule of thumb to aim for about 8&ndash;15 reps per set. Here, the muscle-building effect is large, and it is quite easy to tire out your muscles.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Strength:</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>About 1&ndash;5 reps per set&nbsp;</strong>(&gt;85% of 1RM) is probably most effective for strength gains.</li>\r\n\t<li>Up to about&nbsp;<strong>10&ndash;20 reps per set</strong>&nbsp;(~60% of 1RM) is moderately effective for strength gains, but any lighter than that and the strength gain is small.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that these numbers apply to sets taken to, or close to (within a few reps of)&nbsp;failure. That is, the point where you no longer can do another rep.</p>"}},{"model":"programs.programs","pk":11,"fields":{"author":1,"category":2,"post_date":"2020-08-21","title":"Eating for Muscle Growth: When, How, and How Much to Eat for Adding Lean Mass","snippet":"The three cornerstones of muscle growth are training, rest, and diet.

When you lift weights, you start complicated signaling mechanisms in your muscles. These signals tell your body to start making new muscle protein. After every workout, your muscle protein synthesis increases a bit to the point where it exceeds muscle protein breakdown. Over time, this translates into a noticeably larger muscle mass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While your training makes your muscles bigger, it can&rsquo;t do so all on it&rsquo;s own. You can&rsquo;t build muscle from thin air. If you don&rsquo;t provide enough energy and nutrients from the food you eat, or your efforts will be for naught.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You might have come across claims that the result of your efforts in the gym is 80 percent diet and 20 percent exercise. This is, or course, nonsense, at least if we&rsquo;re talking about building muscle. You can gain muscle as long as you train hard, even if your diet is so-so. As long as you eat&nbsp;<em>enough</em>. What you can&rsquo;t do is eat yourself to a muscular physique without putting in the effort in the gym. Your diet&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the most important factor if you are trying to lose weight and body fat. In that case, changing your diet, as in eating less, is much more effective than trying to lose the weight through exercise alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to gaining muscle mass, your training is the most important factor, at least of the ones you can control. Diet definitely plays a significant role, but the most important thing is simply that you eat enough. As long as your diet is reasonably well put together, details like grams this and minutes that play a very minor, if any, role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you look at various YouTube-videos or read certain fitness blogs, you quickly realize that information about how to eat to build muscle isn&rsquo;t exactly hard to find. The problem is that what someone claims is the superior dietary approach, might be the opposite of what someone else says elsewhere. Quite often, the person making the claims is convinced that he or she has found the holy grail of building muscle. Or that person might have financial reason to make certain claims and to promote a certain product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t applicable to everyone and to all articles, of course. There are some great ones out there. The point is that, as a reader or a viewer, it can be quite difficult to decide which source of information to trust. They all say such wildly different things. Especially if you are new to this yourself. If you read studies or textbooks in nutrition, you will probably be overwhelmed instead. Overwhelmed by information that, while probably correct, might only add to the confusion, not being written for the average person. Or it might not be relevant in practice. All you want to do is to take the information and use it in the gym and in the kitchen to build muscle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, things aren&rsquo;t as complicated as they might seem at first glance. There are a few really important things to keep in mind, things that will make or break your progress. For the most part, details are just that: details. Minor details that you don&rsquo;t really need to micro-manage, at least not until you have reached advanced levels in your training.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Most Important Factors for Gaining Muscle Mass: Calories and Protein</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>There you have it: the two most important dietary factors if you want to gain muscle. Everything else pales in comparison.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Why You Need to Eat Enough Calories</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Protein might be the first thing that comes to mind when you rank dietary components important for muscle growth. Protein is certainly important, but your daily calorie intake is at least as important. Your body is staunchly against adding muscle mass in an energy deficit. You can trick it by training hard and smart, and by timing your protein intake properly. However, there is little doubt that a caloric surplus, or at least a balance between the calories you eat and the calories you expend, provides the superior potential to add muscle. All the anabolic processes in your body like to have plentiful access to energy. In addition, you perform better in the gym if you have enough energy to fuel your workouts. That way, you dont have to break down your body&rsquo;s own tissue to get that fuel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than 100 years ago, scientists demonstrated that athletes can increase their strength and muscle mass with a relatively low protein intake, as long as they eat enough calories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following a workout, your body adds muscle at a faster rate than usual for around 24 hours. Your&nbsp;<em>muscle protein synthesis</em>&nbsp;is elevated. This increase in muscle protein synthesis is amino acid dependent, not energy dependent. This means that eating or drinking some form of protein after a workout results in similarly increased rates of muscle protein synthesis regardless of your calorie intake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But wait! I thought you said calorie intake was crucial for building muscle? It is. You constantly synthesize new muscle protein, 24/7, day in and day out, around the clock, whether you train or not. When you reach adult age, you build and break down similar amounts of muscle tissue, as long as your body weight is stable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This constant, basal muscle protein synthesis depends at least as much on your calorie intake as your protein intake. If you eat too little, you build less muscle, all throughout the day. Even a moderate energy deficit reduces your muscle protein synthesis in a little as 10 days.&nbsp;In other words, even if it is quite possible to gain muscle mass during an energy deficit, you want to eat at least as many calories as you expend, if you want to optimize your potential for muscle growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>A Big Energy Surplus is More Suited for Beginners</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Eating a lot more calories than you burn up might be useful if you are naturally skinny and new to strength training. This will give you the best possible conditions for adding muscle. If you are thin with naturally low body fat levels, overfeeding in this way adds mostly fat free mass, not fat, at least initially. Even without weight training. If you DO add weight training to the equation, you create a powerfully anabolic environment for your muscles to grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, your body can&rsquo;t grow at an unlimited rate. There is a limit to how much muscle protein your body can synthesize per day, week, or whatever measuring period you use. The longer you have trained and the more muscle mass you have already acquired, the lower that limit is. As a beginner with decent genes, you can add a couple of lbs of fat free mass per month. If you are already an advanced athlete with plenty of muscle mass, adding that amount of muscle in a year is reason to celebrate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You simply can&rsquo;t add muscle very fast any more after years of training. Therefore, there is no reason for a massive energy surplus. The only thing synthesized under such conditions is excess body fat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not always easy to guesstimate how many calories you need. There&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;methods that can measure it quite accurately. They are elaborate and expensive, and not intended for home use. Instead, you can use any of a number of equations designed for this very purpose. You simply enter your weight, height, age and sex, plus your activity level and training, and the equation will do the guesstimating for you. These equations are not exact by any means, but will give you a decently accurate number to start with. You can use an&nbsp;online calculator&nbsp;the estimate your caloric needs. This one is based on a scientifically validated equation and is as accurate as these types of equations come. Be sure to use it only to calculate your energy requrements. As a strength-training athlete who wants to gain muscle mass, your protein requirements, for example, will differ from those of the general population.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Protein</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The protein you eat gives you the building materials you need to gain muscle. If you eat too little protein, you will have a much harder time to increase your muscle mass.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How Much Protein Do You Need?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The Recommended Dietary Allowance for protein ranges from 0.8 to 0.83 grams per kilogram of body weight and day for both men and women in the EU and the US.&nbsp;These recommendations ensure enough protein for health and basic needs for the majority of the population, including people who exercise. However, building large muscles is not considered a basic need. If you want to get bigger and stronger, it&rsquo;s definitely a good idea to eat more protein than that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies and meta-analyses show that you reach a limit around 1.6 to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight and day. Adding even more protein does not result in more muscle growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you eat more protein than this amount, nothing bad will happen. But don&rsquo;t expect any extra muscle mass from doing so. You will still absorb and use the additional protein, but not for building muscle. Instead, your body will use it mostly for energy. Nothing wrong with that&nbsp;<em>per se</em>, but it&rsquo;s an expensive energy source, and not the most efficient either.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Even More Protein: Useful for a Few</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>How efficiently you can utilize the protein you eat varies from person to person. This means that there are some who can use more than the previously mentioned 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight and day for muscle-building purposes. We are probably talking about just a few percent of the population. Even for those genetically gifted individuals, it&rsquo;s a matter of diminishing returns. If you really want to make sure you eat enough protein to maximize your potential for muscle growth, you can aim for 2 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight and day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, chances are that you are simply adding more calories that you could have spent on better or better tasting sources of energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>You Need More Protein During a Calorie Deficit</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Everything mentioned above applies to energy balance or above. During an energy deficit, the rules change. If you eat less calories than you take in, during a weight-loss diet, your protein requirements increase. You no longer enjoy the anabolic effects of an energy surplus. The bigger the deficit, the more protein you need to be able to maintain or increase your muscle mass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During periods of calorie restriction, you might need up to 2.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight and day.&nbsp;That is just in order to maintain your fat free mass. Maybe even 3 gram of protein per kilogram, if your body fat levels are already low or if you want to gain muscle mass while dieting. Of course, a calorie deficit is not optimal for muscle growth in the first place. You&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;gain muscle mass and lose fat at the same time, but it is quite a bit more challenging.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How Much Protein from a Single Meal Can Your Body Use to Build Muscle Mass?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Is there an upper limit to how much protein you can absorb or utilize for muscle-building purposes per meal? Or can you pound your entire daily protein intake in one meal and expect the same results?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no practical limit in how much you can&nbsp;<em>absorb.</em>&nbsp;You just won&rsquo;t use all of it to synthesize more muscle protein. There is a limit where more protein in one sitting does not equal any further increase in muscle protein synthesis. This limit is, in fact, not that hard to reach. At rest, it is somewhere between 30 and 40 grams of protein per meal.&nbsp;Following a strength training session, the amount of protein that maximally stimulates muscle protein synthesis is between 20 and 40 grams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.strengthlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/30-or-90-g-protein-in-meal-1.jpg?w=825&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"width:60%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wait, do you need less protein after working out to maximize muscle growth? Yes, probably because your muscles become more sensitive to amino acids after strength training. This allows them to utilize the protein you provide more efficiently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you train a single muscle group, 20 grams of high-quality protein maximize muscle protein synthesis. If you train several muscle groups or a whole body workout, you get 20&ndash;25% higher rates of muscle protein synthesis if you double that amount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.strengthlog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/20-vs-40-g-whey-protein-1.jpg?w=825&amp;ssl=1\" style=\"width:60%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to maximize the potential for muscle growth, you should, according to current recommendations, spread your protein intake out over the day and eat every third hour or so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, any differences such minutiae might offer probably won&rsquo;t be significant. Don&rsquo;t feel that you have to keep nibbling all day long to build muscle mass. It might very well offer some slight advantages. It won&rsquo;t be the factor that determines if you gain muscle or not. If you prefer to eat fewer but larger meals, it&rsquo;s not like your efforts in the gym are wasted. Even if muscle protein synthesis does not increase proportionately after a larger meal, you reduce protein breakdown more and for a longer time instead.&nbsp;This means that larger meals improve the balance between protein synthesis and protein breakdown as well. It is not clear how much of the decreased protein breakdown is muscle protein and how much is protein breakdown in other tissues, though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A meta-analysis could not find any differences in body composition depending on meal frequency.&nbsp;In addition, there are many real-life examples of athletes building muscle and improving body composition using an intermittent fasting diet plan. As we said earlier: the most important thing for muscle growth is your training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Best:</strong>&nbsp;a high protein intake spread out over multiple meals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Good:</strong>&nbsp;a high protein intake divided into a few meals. Your total protein intake is more important than your meal frequency.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>All Protein Counts</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s easy to assume that you should only count protein from &ldquo;clean&rdquo; protein sources like meat, fish, poultry, protein powder, and so on. That is not the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you see recommendations like &ldquo;2 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight and day&rdquo;, they include&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;the protein you eat and drink during a day. This means that you should include the protein from foods you might normally not think of as protein sources, like bread, grains, and so on, in your total protein count. It also means that you will have a much easier time reaching your protein goal for the day than you might think. If you aim for, say, 180 grams of protein per day, it is not all that hard to reach that amount if you count the protein in everything you eat, not just the pure protein sources in your diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Do You Need More Protein as You Get Older?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>When you reach a certain age, your muscles start responding less to a protein-rich feeding. This phenomenon is called amino acid resistance. Your muscles no longer react as strongly to amino acids in your blood.&nbsp;The signals for muscle protein synthesis diminish, and you need more protein than before to elicit the same response. When this reduced response to protein feeding occurs is not clear, and it probably happens at a very individual rate. In the beginning, it&rsquo;s likely not noticable. Somewhere around the 60-year mark, maybe. A qualified guess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of the regular 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight and day, elderly individuals need 1 to 1.3 grams per kilogram and day for health and performance.&nbsp;However, nothing indicates that elderly athletes who engage in strength training need a higher total protein intake than their younger counterparts. The previously mentioned amounts of 1.6 to 2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight and day should cover the requirements for maximal muscle growth, regardless of age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The age-related amino acid resistance happens both for the general population as a whole and for veteran athletes who drink a protein shake after a training session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a workout, elderly individuals should consume 40 grams of protein for maximal anabolic response, regardless of the number of muscle groups trained. Younger athletes don&rsquo;t need more than 20 grams of protein after training a single muscle group, but older athletes should aim for 40 grams of post-exercise protein every workout.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Protein Quality: Do Your Protein Sources Matter?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Protein quality indicates how well a food protein contributes to the amino acid requirements for growth or maintenance. In other words, how efficiently you can use it to build muscle and other tissue. Protein quality is highly dependent on the amount and ratio of the essential amino acids the food protein contains. Essential amino acids are the amino acids your body can&rsquo;t make on it&rsquo;s own, the ones you have to provide through your diet. Only the essential amino acids are necessary to stimulate muscle protein synthesis.&nbsp;Too little of one or more of the essential amino acids results in sub-optimal muscle protein synthesis the hours after a meal. If a protein provides enough of all the essential amino acids, it is considered a&nbsp;<em>complete protein.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All proteins from animal sources are complete and provide you with all the essential amino acids, in the proper ratios, that you need for muscle protein synthesis. The exceptions are collagen and gelatin protein, which provide limiting amounts of several amino acids needed for muscle protein synthesis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In theory, you could pick a single animal protein and meet your entire protein requirement with that single source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you eat a mixed diet containing protein from both animal and vegetable sources, you don&rsquo;t have to keep track of the protein quality of your meals. It takes care of itself. You don&rsquo;t have to include meat in your diet. Eggs or dairy work just as well or even better in this regard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A diet without any animal products, a vegan diet, does not provide the same amount of high quality protein, if you look at individual protein sources. All vegetable proteins also provide all essential amino acids, but a little less of the ones used to build muscle. This means that you either have to eat more of the vegetable proteins to get the same amount of amino acids from them, or combine different vegetable protein sources for a more complete amino acid profile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, your body can combine amino acids from different proteins on it&rsquo;s own. It can take amino acids from a protein that has an excess of a certain amino acid and combine it with another protein which is deficient of said amino acid. This way, the anabolic effect of the combined vegetable protein sources becomes comparable to any animal protein source like meat or eggs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, a widely held belief said that you need to combine vegetable protein sources in the same meal to get a complete and fully usable protein source. Today, we know that our protein metabolism is efficient enough to make this practice unnecessary. It is enough to vary vegetable protein sources throughout the day as a whole. Your body can combine amino acids from different meals spread out over the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, this has only been measured in untrained individuals. Whether or not the same holds true for a strength athlete looking to gain a maximum amount of muscle is currently not known. To ensure you get enough high quality protein for this purpose, it might be prudent to either combine several vegetable protein sources in the same meal or at least shoot for the high end of the recommendations for protein intake, 2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight and day.&nbsp;This way, you get more essential amino acids, even if the individual protein sources don&rsquo;t contain the same amount as a mixed diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In summary, you most likely don&rsquo;t have to calculate protein quality on a spreadsheet before eating, even if your diet contains no animal protein at all. If you follow a vegan diet, consider using more than a single protein source in each meal, preferably something like legumes and grains, which complement each other, or eat more protein total. If you eat a mixed diet containing at least some animal protein, whether we&rsquo;re talking about meat, eggs or dairy products, your body will take care of things on its own.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Do You Need Protein Immediately Following a Training Session?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>No, but consuming some form of protein within a reasonable time following a workout might be beneficial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hours after a training session, muscle protein synthesis is elevated above normal levels to the point where it exceeds muscle protein breakdown. For this to happen, you need to make the necessary amino acids available for your muscles to use. If the amino acids levels in your blood aren&rsquo;t high enough after a workout, muscle protein synthesis can&rsquo;t exceed muscle protein breakdown. It&rsquo;s up to you to make sure you provide the building blocks your muscles need, by eating or drinking protein in some form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ingesting some form of protein immediately before a strength training session provides the same anabolic stimulus as the same amount of protein post-exercise.&nbsp;In other words, if you eat or drink protein right before a strength training session, you get the same muscle-building effect as from chugging a shake after the workout. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to make any difference in the long run, either.&nbsp;The important thing is that you have sufficient amounts of amino acids in your blood when muscle protein synthesis starts to take off into the stratosphere, which happens around an hour after a workout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can&rsquo;t chow down a can of tuna as an evening snack and utilize that protein after your morning workout the next day, however. By that time, your plasma amino acid levels have dropped back to normal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following a workout, your&nbsp;<em>amino acid sensitivity</em>&nbsp;is increased above normal levels for up to 24 hours.&nbsp;What this means for you is that any protein you eat or drink during this time will be used more efficiently to build muscle than if you hadn&rsquo;t trained. This also means that it is not crucial that you grab your shaker the moment you finish your last set. Your amino acid sensitivity is likely the highest the hours closest following the workout, after which it slowly returns to normal. However, studies show that you get the same anabolic effect of ingesting amino acids or protein for at least three hours after a training session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact that it is not super-important to drink a protein shake the minute you&rsquo;re done with your workout doesn&rsquo;t mean that protein timing in relation to strength training is completely unimportant. If you train completely fasted&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;neglect your protein intake for many hours after the workout, you will lose out on time you could have been building muscle. In the fasted state, muscle protein breakdown always exceeds muscle protein synthesis.&nbsp;Fasted strength training improves the balance between synthesis and breakdown, but it can&rsquo;t turn positive until you provide the building blocks, the protein. So, if you haven&rsquo;t eaten any form of protein before working out, it&rsquo;s a good idea to make sure you do so afterwards instead. If you did provide the building blocks your muscles need prior to your workouts you are in much less of a hurry to do so again when you are done training.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Good Protein Sources, Loosely Ranked for Muscle Building Potential</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Milk and dairy products (milk, yoghurt, cheese, cottage cheese, quark, casein- and whey protein powder)</li>\r\n\t<li>Eggs</li>\r\n\t<li>Red meat (beef, pork, lamb, game, ostrich)</li>\r\n\t<li>White meat (chicken, turkey)</li>\r\n\t<li>Fish and seafood</li>\r\n\t<li>Soy-based foods (tofu, tempeh, edamame, soy protein powder)</li>\r\n\t<li>Quinoa</li>\r\n\t<li>Beans, lentils</li>\r\n\t<li>Nuts, almonds, seeds</li>\r\n\t<li>Grains</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the food you eat, in addition to the ones listed above, also contain protein, albeit in smaller amounts. That protein might not always be of the highest quality. However, it does contribute to your daily protein intake and can be utilized for building muscle, and you should count it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Carbohydrates and Fats: Do They Build Muscle?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Neither carbohydrate or fat have any muscle building properties right after you eat them. They don&rsquo;t stimulate muscle protein synthesis. They are, on the other hand, important sources of energy for everything from essential processes in your body to your daily activities and your training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fat is essential, carbohydrates are not. You need to eat at least some fat to live and be healthy, but you can go your entire life without eating a single gram of carbs. That does not mean that carbs are bad. On the contrary, especially if you train hard. Carbohydrates are stored in your muscles and can fuel your intense workouts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How you should allocate the fat and carbohydrate you take in is almost completely up to you. All kinds of diets, from low-fat diets with a lot of carbohydrates to ketogenic diets almost devoid of carbohydrate, work fine for muscle-building purposes. This means that you have great flexibility in how you eat. You can simply base your choice of foods on the way you like to eat. There is no convincing evidence that one or the other, high carb or low carb, high fat or low fat, or anything in between, are superior to any other choice.&nbsp;Not as long as your protein intake and your total calorie intake are the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How Much Fat and Carbohydrate Should You Eat?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>An easy way to figure out how much fat and carbohydrate you should eat is to start with your total calorie intake and subtract the number of calories your protein intake provides from that number. Whatever number you come up with is how many calories you have left to spend on fat and carbohydrate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is how you do it:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Estimate the number of calories you need every day.&nbsp;You can use a good&nbsp;online calculator&nbsp;for this purpose.</li>\r\n\t<li>Calculate how much protein you need per day. A good and even number is 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. It is scientifically accurate and easy to multiply your body weight with. For example, if you weigh 80 kilograms, you need 160 grams of protein a day, counting the protein in everything you eat and drink.</li>\r\n\t<li>Subtract the protein calories from your daily calorie intake. It&rsquo;s a simple equation. Each gram of protein provides 4 calories, rounded off. If you eat those 160 grams of protein, you get 640 calories. Let&rsquo;s assume you found out that you need 2,500 calories per day to be in caloric balance. Add 200 calories to that number to make sure you have a slight energy surplus for optimal hypertrophic potential. 2,700 minus 640 is 2,060 calories. There you have it! The number of calories you have left to play with and spend on carbohydrates and fats.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Carbohydrates also provide 4 calories per gram, just like protein. Fat, on the other hand, provides a whopping 9 calories per gram. How you allocate these calories is almost entirely up to you and your own preferences. You cannot and should not completely eliminate fat, but a fat intake as low as 20% of your total calorie intake is not a problem for a bodybuilder.&nbsp;A lower fat intake than that might not be the best of ideas, as it could compromise your health and your hormones in the long run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;A great interval for your daily fat intake is 0.5 to 1.5 grams per kilogram of body weight. After that, you fill up with carbohydrate energy until you reach your intended daily calorie intake. This leaves a lot of room for flexibility. You can adjust your balance between fat and carbs in other ways, too, but these are great guidelines for anyone wanting to build muscle while eating a balanced diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You don&rsquo;t have to compose your individual meals in any particular way or measure your carbs and your fats on a meal-to-meal basis. The important thing is getting enough over a longer period of time. The only firm guideline for each meal is that it should provide enough protein, in the amounts discussed earlier in the article. You don&rsquo;t need to eat X grams of carbs or Y grams of fat each meal. You can mix and match to your heart&rsquo;s content. As long you end up in the ballpark of your intended total daily intake, it&rsquo;s all good.. In the end, that&rsquo;s the important thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Fat and Carbohydrate Quality</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike protein, fats and carbs don&rsquo;t have different anabolic properties depending on their source the hours after you eat them. In addition, there is no immediate difference between fat- and carbohydrate-rich foods generally considered &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; or &ldquo;unhealthy&rdquo; in this regard. You won&rsquo;t build less muscle after a meal consisting of gingerbread cookies compared to a meal of rice and olive oil, if they both provide the same amount of fat and carbohydrate and the same number of calories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does this mean that you can base your diet on junk food how much you want without any negative effect on your training results? No, not in the long run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Different types of carbohydrates, like starch and sugars, and foods with different fatty acid composition, do not have the same effect on your body. We&rsquo;re not talking dramatic differences the hours after you eat them, but over time. A diet based on &ldquo;junk&rdquo;, consisting mostly of sugary foods and an unfavorable fatty acid composition, will negatively affect your health in the long run. Things like inflammations and blood lipids eventually take a turn for the worse, at least on a calorie surplus. Sooner or later, this will, in turn, negatively affect your training and your results. In addition, you will struggle to get all the vitamins, minerals and trace elements you need on a junk food diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want the best results possible from your efforts in the gym, you need to give your muscles good nutrients and fuel. You should base your diet on unrefined foods, not refined and processed so-called &ldquo;junk&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That being said, you don&rsquo;t have to follow a pre-contest diet during the off-season. You don&rsquo;t have to&nbsp;<em>exclude</em>&nbsp;anything. You can eat anything, but not all the time. This saying is particularly useful when you want to lose weight, but it applies here as well. The difference is that you have a lot more room to eat what you want when you are not dieting to lose weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The important thing to keep in mind is BASING your diet on unrefined and healthy food. A limited amount of &ldquo;junk&rdquo; can be a part of any diet, including the one you use to fuel your gym sessions and build muscle. It won&rsquo;t harm anything. In fact, if you are a &ldquo;hardgainer&rdquo;, someone who finds it hard to eat enough to gain weight and muscle, or if you have a physically demanding job outside of training, it might even be beneficial to include a certain amount of refined foods that are easier to eat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In summary, you definitely don&rsquo;t have to exclude treats like ice cream and candy or fast food like pizza and burgers. The last two examples aren&rsquo;t even as bad as people often think. They provide pretty much everything your muscles need to grow after an intense workout, although you probably shouldn&rsquo;t plan your entire diet around them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is a list of excellent basic, staple foods and carbohydrate sources:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Bread</li>\r\n\t<li>Pasta</li>\r\n\t<li>Grains</li>\r\n\t<li>Rice</li>\r\n\t<li>Potatoes, both regular and sweet potatoes</li>\r\n\t<li>Bulgur</li>\r\n\t<li>Quinoa</li>\r\n\t<li>Beans</li>\r\n\t<li>Lentils</li>\r\n\t<li>Fruits</li>\r\n\t<li>Berries</li>\r\n\t<li>Vegetables</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The optimal fatty acid composition for health and performance is up for debate. Literally up for debate, all the time. How much unsaturated fat should you eat, and is saturated fat the devil? If you base your diet on natural, unrefined foods rather than refined and processed choices, you probably don&rsquo;t have to give it a lot of thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saturated fat has a bad reputation, but if you are healthy and exercise regularly, you likely don&rsquo;t have to worry overmuch about it or try to avoid things like butter or red meat, foods that contain a lot of saturated fatty acids. A high intake of processed meats are correlated with health issues, and it is prudent to limit your intake of those, but not because of the fat content.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What About Vitamins, Minerals and Trace Elements?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike the macronutrients, meaning protein, fat and carbohydrate, these nutrients do not provide any calories. On the other hand, they are very important, essential even, for your health and physical function. Many of them have direct or indirect effects on your muscles, your strength, and your potential for muscle growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, they do not possess any acute anabolic effects following ingestion. You just need to eat a reasonably varied diet to cover your vitamin, mineral, and trace element needs in general. Timing your micronutrient intake in relation to your workouts isn&rsquo;t important at all. You don&rsquo;t have to optimize your intake of every nutrient every day for health or hypertrophy reasons. The important thing is to make sure you get enough of them over time so you don&rsquo;t develop any deficiencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A reasonably varied diet that covers your energy needs also covers your vitamin and mineral requirements, as a general rule, regardless of whether you engage in strength training or not. A few exceptions can be vitamin D during the winter half of the year and vitamin B12 if you don&rsquo;t eat any animal products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A very common belief is that fruits and vegetables are the richest sources of vitamins and minerals. Contrary to this belief, foods from animal sources are actually often the most micronutrient-dense foods you can eat, with the exception of vitamin C. Still, a varied intake of fruits and vegetables, and preferably a plentiful one, too, is a good idea if your goal is gaining muscle mass. Even if you could cover your vitamin requirements completely without them, they also provide phytochemicals and other chemicals that have many functions in your body. We don&rsquo;t even know exactly how these chemicals work in conjunction with each other, and it is not far-fetched to imagine that they are also involved in processes regulating muscle mass.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eat enough calories.</strong>&nbsp;Building muscle during an energy deficit is possible, but far from optimal. Aiming for at least calorie balance is a good idea, and a slight surplus can offer additional benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eat enough protein.</strong>&nbsp;This entails eating at least 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight and day. You can increase that amount to 2&ndash;2.2 grams per kilogram if you want to be 100% on the safe side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>When you have ensured that you get enough protein, you can allocate your fat and carbohydrate calories according to your personal preferences.</strong>&nbsp;You can gain muscle mass with all kinds of diets, including high-carbohydrate plans with low to moderate amounts of fat, and ketogenic diets devoid of carbohydrates, to mention the two extremes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Spreading your protein intake out over the day is most likely beneficial.</strong>&nbsp;Thirty to forty grams of protein every third or fourth hour during your waking time seems optimal. However, it is not essential. If you prefer a more infrequent meal plan, eating larger but less frequent meals, that will work fine as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You don&rsquo;t have to eat super-healthy all the time.</strong>&nbsp;When you are on a contest diet, you rarely have the luxury of indulging just because you crave something. However, &ldquo;junk food&rdquo; does not build less muscle than &ldquo;clean&rdquo; food, as long as you cover your calorie- and protein requirements anyway. You&nbsp;<em>should</em>&nbsp;base your diet on healthy and mostly unrefined foods, for the sake of your long-term health and in order to get enough micronutrients. When that&rsquo;s taken care of, your results won&rsquo;t suffer if you have a bowl of ice cream instead of&nbsp;<em>even more</em>&nbsp;broccoli and tilapia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What you do in the gym is the most important factor to grow bigger and stronger</strong>, but without a sound diet your efforts can more or less go to waste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You don&rsquo;t have to count and measure everything you eat down to the smallest detail,</strong>&nbsp;as long as you keep a decent track of your calories and your protein intake. It&rsquo;s neither difficult or time-consuming to eat enough and well enough to build muscle. A few easy choices and a little planning are all you need to give your muscles what&nbsp;<em>they</em>&nbsp;need. Hopefully, this article has provided you with the information you need to make the informed choices in the kitchen that give you the results you want in the gym.</p>"}},{"model":"programs.programs","pk":12,"fields":{"author":1,"category":2,"post_date":"2020-08-21","title":"Protein for Strength Athletes and Bodybuilders – How Much, How Often, and What Kind","snippet":"The term “protein” is derived from the Greek word for primary.

For athletes, this often refers to muscle protein, to stimulate the synthesis of new muscle protein and to reduce muscle protein breakdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During periods of energy balance, the skeletal muscle mass of an untrained adult individual remains relatively unchanged over time. Regular physical activity, especially resistance training, increases muscle protein synthesis, as does protein ingestion. The combined effect of exercise and protein ingestion is greater than the sum of its parts. Over time, the combination of resistance training and protein-rich feedings translates to&nbsp;muscle growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Protein is made up of building blocks called amino acids. Out of the 21 amino acids used to make the proteins required for health, growth, and repair, 9 are considered essential. Essential means that these amino acids cannot be synthesized in the body but have to be provided through dietary means. These 9 essential amino acids are also the ones required for muscle growth and muscle protein synthesis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ten grams of essential amino acids plus 10 grams of non-essential amino acids do not provide a more robust stimulation of muscle protein synthesis than 10 grams of essential amino acids alone. This indicates that non-essential amino acids are not required to promote muscle protein synthesis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond acting as substrates for protein synthesis, amino acids also serve as triggers to initiate an anabolic response, both at rest and post-exercise. Following protein ingestion, plasma amino acid levels increase, regulating signal mechanisms that initiate protein synthesis in skeletal muscle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Protein does not need to be ingested in combination with other macronutrients in order to stimulate muscle protein synthesis maximally. When ample amounts of protein is provided, adding carbohydrate does not further stimulate muscle protein synthesis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insulin&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;required for the amino acid-stimulated muscle protein response to protein feedings, but this is not due to any effect on muscle protein synthesis by insulin&nbsp;<em>per se</em>. Rather, insulin increases amino acid availability, but this effect requires only fasting levels of insulin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insulin reduces muscle protein breakdown, but this effect plateaus at relatively low levels of insulin, achievable by protein ingestion alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Protein Recommendations for the General Population and Athletic Adults</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>For many decades, protein recommendations for active adults and athletes were static and focused mainly on overall total daily protein intake and sport-specific requirements. Current recommendations have evolved to reflect the needs of the individual athlete depending on body composition, training goals, health and the acute requirements of a training session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More attention has also been given to protein periodization in recent years, including meal frequency, timing of protein intake in relation to training sessions, and protein distribution over the course of the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Population Reference Intake (PRI) for protein is 0.83 grams of protein per kilogram of body mass per day.&nbsp;The US recommendeded daily intake is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body mass per day.&nbsp;These are not the amounts recommended for optimal health and performance, but rather the amounts required to cover basic protein needs for 98% of the population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These recommended amounts are based on nitrogen balance calculations, a method that has been criticized in recent years. Studies using the indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) method to calculate protein requirements have indicated that recommendations should be up to 50 % higher for the optimal health of the general population. This would bring general protein requirements up to 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body mass per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elderly individuals have a diminished anabolic response to feeding and exercise. In this population, 1.0 to 1.3 grams of protein per kilogram of body mass per day is likely needed to optimize health and physical function.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Protein Requirements for Athletes</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>When the current RDI values were set, the notion of consumption beyond what is considered adequate to optimize training adaptations was not considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are studies that indicate that athletes who habitually engage in endurance or resistance training have higher protein requirements than their sedentary counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Resistance training might increase protein requirements to meet the need for more protein to form new muscle protein, initiate muscle protein synthesis, and repair damaged muscle protein. Endurance training increases amino acid oxidation, especially leucine oxidation, which would translate into an overall greater requirement for dietary protein.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A review article from 2011 recommends that athletes consume 1.3-1.8 gram of protein per kilogram of body mass per day to maximize muscle protein synthesis during periods of energy balance or above. It was also concluded that athletes should increase their protein intake to 1.8-2.7 grams per kilogram of body mass per day to ensure that muscle mass is maintained during hypoenergetic diets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Protein Requirements for Bodybuilders and Strength Athletes</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Bodybuilders and strength athletes seeking to maximize the anabolic response to training might benefit from even higher protein intakes. A 2018 meta-analysis concluded that a total protein intake of 1.62 grams of protein per kilogram of body mass per day maximized training-induced gains in fat-free mass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A recent study which aimed to assess the protein requirements of young male bodybuilders using IAAO-testing found that protein oxidation plateaued at an average intake or 1.7 grams per kilogram of body mass per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This indicates that this amount would be needed to optimize the anabolic effects of total daily protein intake. However, there seems to be some variability in individual protein requirements, and the upper end of the confidence interval in this study reached 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram and body mass per day. This was measured during a rest day, so the requirements on a training day could potentially be even higher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These results suggest that 1.6-1.7 grams of protein per kilogram and body mass per day is enough to cover the protein requirements of most strength athletes, but individual variability might increase this to 2.2 grams per kilogram and body mass per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Protein Per Meal</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>There are only a few studies that have examined how much protein can be utilized to synthesize new muscle protein per meal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two studies have determined that 20 grams of either egg or whey protein maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis after resistance training.&nbsp;Increasing the amount of protein in a single dose beyond 20 grams only resulted in increased amino acid oxidation and ureagenesis. The amount of protein that maximized post-exercise protein synthesis in these two studies also resulted in maximizing muscle protein synthesis at rest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The training session employed in these two studies only targeted a single muscle group. A 2014 study showed that after a whole body workout, 40 grams of protein further stimulated muscle protein synthesis. Double the amount of protein did, however, not double the muscle protein synthetic response, but rather increased it a further 22%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Measuring muscle protein synthesis following whole food intake, a 2009 study found that 90 grams of protein from lean beef did not produce a more pronounced anabolic response than 30 grams, despite a threefold increase in energy content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In elderly individuals, larger doses of protein per intake might be needed to maximize rates of muscle protein synthesis. One study found that older adults need higher protein doses following resistance training to optimize muscle protein synthesis, regardless of how many muscle groups are worked in a training session. While post-exercise rates of muscle protein synthesis plateaus with 20 grams of protein post-exercise in young individuals, 40 grams of protein is likely needed to achieve the same effect in the elderly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given that the amount of protein required to maximize muscle protein synthesis seems to be around 20-30 grams of protein, it might be prudent to target multiple moderate-sized meals rather than one or two larger meals if the goal is to optimize muscle growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &ldquo;muscle full&rdquo;-effect further supports this notion. When high plasma leucine concentrations are sustained over a long time through multiple close protein feedings, there is a refractory response where muscle protein synthesis decreases to basal levels despite high amino acid availability.&nbsp;Therefore, an ingestion pattern of moderate-sized servings of protein spread out over the course of the day will maximize the anabolic response to each individual feeding.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Protein Timing</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>In the fasted state, muscle protein breakdown exceeds that of muscle protein synthesis. Exercise increases both muscle protein synthesis and muscle protein breakdown, but muscle protein balance remains negative until amino acids are available. Even without amino acid availability, however, muscle protein balance is improved following resistance training, due to a larger increase in muscle protein synthesis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many studies have provided evidence that resistance training in combination with feeding acts in synergy to provide a more substantial anabolic response than either training or feeding alone. Most research have focused on post-exercise nutrition, with amino acids or intact protein provided immediately or in the hours following training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Post-exercise, there seems to be a dose-dependent muscle protein synthesis response to amino acid intake, plateauing at 10 mg of essential amino acids in a single bolus intake.&nbsp;Early studies used free amino acids, but later research has revealed that intact proteins, from protein supplements like whey protein powder as well as from food sources like eggs, beef, soy, and whole milk provide the same effect, as long as the essential amino acid content is equivalent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies on how post-exercise protein supplementation translates into actual muscle hypertrophy and strength gains provide ambiguous results. While some studies show improved body composition and increased strength as the result of post-exercise protein supplementation, others do not report any advantages with such a protocol compared to protein intake during other times of the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A meta-analysis found that protein intake within an hour after a workout had significant effects on muscular hypertrophy compared to a delayed feeding. This advantage disappeared after controlling for total dietary protein intake, however. In studies showing increased rates of muscle growth as the result of post-exercise protein intake, the protein supplementation also increased the total protein intake compared to control groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is well known that post-exercise protein intake results in a rapid increase in amino acid levels in the blood and activates signaling pathways which regulate muscle protein synthesis. However, it is unclear if immediate post-exercise nutrition confers any significant advantage over consuming the same amount of protein at some other time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similar rates of post-exercise muscle protein synthesis have been observed when essential amino acids or protein are provided immediately before a workout instead of afterwards. Not many studies have examined the effects of pre-exercise protein intake, but one 2017 article showed similar effects on muscular adaptations from post- and pre-exercise protein supplementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is unknown if this translates to different gains in strength and muscle mass over longer periods of time compared to post-exercise feedings, or if protein intakes both before and after a workout would confer any unique benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If resistance training is performed in the fasted state, it might be advantageous to ingest some form of protein within a reasonable time following the training session to turn the negative muscle protein balance of the fasted state into a positive one. If the training session is performed in the hours following a normal meal, amino acid availability is likely already high enough so that another pre-exercise protein feeding would not confer any additional benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The total daily amount of protein is likely to be the major determining factor regarding the hypertrophic effects of protein intake, while timing of a single protein intake in relation to a training session might confer some additional benefits. Following exercise, amino acid sensitivity is increased for up to 24 hours,&nbsp;which means that the synergistic effects of resistance training and protein intake last a long time, although it is likely to be highest during the first hours post-exercise.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Protein Sources</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The most common protein-rich foods include the meat of ruminants, fish, poultry, seafood, and game, but also products procured&nbsp;<em>from</em>&nbsp;animals, such as dairy and eggs, and plant-based foods like legumes, nuts, and seeds. Animal sources of protein are the ones containing the highest amounts of essential amino acids, the amino acids needed to stimulate muscle protein synthesis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>L-leucine in particular stands out as the amino acid that initiates the anabolic response to feeding. Animal protein sources generally have a higher leucine content than vegetable sources. To produce a robust stimulatory effect on muscle protein synthesis, at least 3 grams of leucine must be ingested in a single meal.&nbsp;This is called the &ldquo;leucine threshold&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditionally, plant-based protein sources have been considered less valuable for muscle protein synthesis, and while this might be true on a gram-for-gram basis, increasing the amount of protein in a given meal might also increase the anabolic potential to equal that of animal protein. Other strategies to augment the anabolic properties of plant protein include combining multiple protein sources, or adding amino acids to a lower quality protein source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not necessary to combine different plant-based protein sources in a meal to ensure a sufficient amount of essential amino acids for the general population.&nbsp;However, it is not known if this is also the case for bodybuilders and strength athletes seeking to maximize training adaptations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When a suboptimal amount of protein is ingested, the lower anabolic response might be rescued by adding enough leucine to the meal to reach the leucine threshold.&nbsp;Thus, simply eating more of a plant-based protein until the leucine threshold is reached would make its efficacy equal to that of a protein source with a higher leucine content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most research on the muscle protein synthetic response to protein ingestion in relation to resistance training has focused on powdered protein sources. These include whey protein, casein protein, soy protein, beef protein, pea protein, and egg protein. They all seem to effectively stimulate protein synthesis following exercise, and while leucine-rich proteins like whey generally provide a more robust stimulation of muscle protein synthesis, increasing the amount of protein from other sources might negate that difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When similar amounts of protein is consumed, however, leucine-rich protein sources like dairy promote larger gains in muscle protein, and the &nbsp;habitual consumption of such sources likely leads to greater muscular hypertrophy.&nbsp;(26)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The amount of research on the consumption of whole foods following a training session is limited. Two studies indicate that it is a viable alternative to powdered nutrition.. After the consumption of whole milk following resistance training, one study demonstrated a greater amino acid uptake across the exercised leg compared to skim milk. This should presumably also translate into greater muscle protein synthesis. Similarly, another study showed a greater post-exercise muscle protein synthetic response when whole eggs were consumed compared to egg whites, even when the protein content was matched.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A healthy diet should include various protein sources as part of mixed meals, where protein is co-ingested with other macronutrients and micronutrients for a complete approach to nutrition. When convenience demands it, such as following a training session, protein supplements offer a practical alternative.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Protein Safety</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Concerns about high protein diets in regards to kidney damage and increased excretion of calcium still exist. Results from studies on renal patients have been extrapolated to include healthy, active individuals, regardless of the fact that no evidence indicating harmful effects of a high protein intake in a healthy population exists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The World Health Organization has published reports indicating that there is no evidence linking protein intake to renal disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Short-term studies indicate that a protein intake of 3-4 grams of protein per kilogram of body mass per day does not result in any clinical side effects. A year-long study did not show any harmful effects on liver or kidney function or blood lipids when participants consumed 3.3 grams of protein per kilogram of body mass per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent epidemiological studies suggest that a high (&gt;20% of the energy intake) protein intake might increase the risk of cancer and type 2 diabetes, but these studies do not establish causation and do not take into account the quality of the protein sources, for example processed meats, which are known to have detrimental health effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Key Points</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>During periods of positive energy balance, a protein intake of 1.6 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body mass per day will be sufficient for the vast majority of strength athletes to sustain muscle growth.</li>\r\n\t<li>During periods of energy restriction, up to 2.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body mass per day might be required to curtail the loss of fat-free mass.</li>\r\n\t<li>The optimal dose of protein to maximize acute muscle protein synthesis seems to be 20-40 grams of protein per serving, depending on age and training status.</li>\r\n\t<li>Protein intakes up to 3.3 grams of protein per kilogram of body mass per day for at least a year do not seem detrimental to any health markers in healthy individuals.</li>\r\n\t<li>Total protein intake is the most important consideration, while details like protein timing and distribution might confer additional, but smaller, benefits.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Take-Home Message</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Protein is important. Make sure to consume enough of it.</p>"}}]
